    <h1>Foxes</h1>
        <p>Foxes make up a large part of the dog family. What is to be considered 
        a fox is a question of definition. Some believe the name should be 
        reserved for species in the genus Vulpes, while others include all 
        species where "fox" has become part of the name. In general, foxes 
        are the smallest and most slender members of the canine family.

   <h1> Genus and distribution</h1>
        There are 23 species of foxes in 4 genera. 
        The genera are:
    
        Urocyon: gray fox, 2 species in North America, one of which 
        is widespread south to the northernmost South America. The 
        genus is considered the oldest, it is 4-6 million years old.
    
        Otocyon: ear fox, 1 species, O. megalotis, living in Africa.
    
        Vulpes: foxes, 12 species, are found naturally throughout the 
        northern hemisphere except the most arctic regions, as well as
        in Africa. The red fox is perhaps the most widespread mammal in the world.
    
        Dusicyon: zorroer, 8 species living in South America. These are 
        also called South American gray foxes. They are more closely related
        to species in the canine genus Canis than to the other three fox genera.</p>

    <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Foxes are mostly small and slender predators, most species weigh between 
        two and five kg. The smallest is the fennel with 0.8 kg, while the largest
        is "small ear azure". microtis with 9 kg. They often have large ears, a 
        long, bushy tail and a pointed snout. The coat is mostly shades of gray and
        brown with white and black spots. The red fox is more reddish, but has a
        black color variant in the silver fox. The mountain fox also comes in 
        two color variants; white fox and blue fox.
        
        <h1>Living</h1>
        Foxes are typically extremely opportunistic in their way of life. 
        They eat almost everything that is possible to catch and eat where they
        live, but most prefer small mammals as small rodents. They also eat 
        insects, earthworms, hares, birds, scavengers, fish, fruits and berries,
        as well as small ungulates (especially young). Where several foxes overlap
        in distribution, competition for food can lead to variations in food
        choices and also to changes in body size. The fox has completely 
        specialized in insects, it eats a lot of termites. It uses its large 
        ears as dishes to listen for crawling insects. For foxes in general, 
        both hearing and sense of smell are important in the search for food.</p>
