    <h1>Monkeys</h1>
        <p>True monkeys, anthropoids, monkeys, Anthropoidea, are a mammalian 
        suborder in the order primates. Real monkeys include so-called higher 
        primates; monkeys and monkeys with animal monkeys as well as apes and 
        humans, with about 150 species in six families.

    <h1>Structure</h1>
        A monkey usually has a round head, but in some the face is extended to 
        a snout. The face is usually hairless. The eyes are directed forward and 
        sit relatively close together, while the nose is greatly reduced. They can 
        thus fix one point with both eyes, have stereoscopic (three-dimensional) 
        vision and the yellow spot on the retina. Unlike most other vertebrates, 
        monkeys are thus "eye animals", but not "nose animals". The eye sockets are 
        separated from the temporal pit by a bone wall, and the cerebrum is remarkably
        strongly developed. The skull is therefore also large.All monkeys have in each half of the 
        jaw two front teeth, a canine, two or three
        molars and three molars. All cheek teeth are gnarled and have low crowns. The limbs,
        arms, are usually longer than the body and legs. The forearm can be rotated so that 
        the thumb points towards the body (pronation) and from the body (supination), and the
        hand and foot have five fingers and toes with flat nails.
    
    <h1>Living</h1>
        Some monkeys are omnivorous, but most species are herbivores. Some leafy species have 
        a highly specialized stomach - it is strikingly long and multi-chambered. The monkeys 
        live partly in monogamy, partly in polygamy, and the kid, who is completely helpless 
        in the first time, is cared for and cared for with the utmost care.
    
        Monkeys often live together in large herds consisting of many families, with an old
        male leading. They are almost exclusively tropical animals. They are predominantly
        adapted to life in the trees, but many can also move with great ease on all fours 
        on the ground and then step on the entire palm and foot.
        
    
    <h1>Systematics</h1>
        The subordinate real monkeys are divided into three superfamilies:

        <li>Ceboidea, broad-leaved monkeys or western monkeys, with the families Capuchin 
        monkeys (Cebidae) and silk monkeys (Callitrichidae);</li>
        <li>Cercopithecoidea, narrow monkeys, monkeys or monkeys, with the family Monkeys 
        (Cercopithecidae);</li>
        <li>Hominoidea, humans and apes, with the families Gibbons (Hylobatidae) and great
        apes (Hominidae).</li>
