    <p>Parrots are an order of birds. Some examples of parrots are cockatoos, 
        macaws and budgies. Among other things, due to a thick tongue, many parrots 
        can become good at talking, and they are popular as pets.

    <h1>Description</h1>
        The parrots are often wonderfully colored, but many are also solid green. 
        They have a curved, powerful beak, and the upper beak is articulated towards 
        the forehead and is extra movable. Two toes facing forward and two backward. 
        Parrots often get very old in captivity; several species can be about 100 years old.
    
    <h1>Prevalence</h1>
        The parrots are widespread in tropical and subtropical regions. Most species 
        live in the Australian region up to Southeast Asia, some in Africa and many in
        South America, partly up to Central America.
    
        At least two species have established free-living populations in Europe as a 
        result of releases or escapes from captivity: collar parakeet from Africa / 
        Asia and monk parakeet, Myiopsitta monachus, from South America.
    
        Karolina parakeet is a well-known example of a bird species that has become 
        extinct by humans.

    <h1>Types</h1>
        The parrots (order parrot birds) include around 350 species, including the 
        most famous of all cage birds, the budgerigar. Large parrots in cages are 
        preferably jako or amazon parrots, but can also be macaws, the world's largest
        parrots (up to one meter long).
    
        The parrots are today divided into four families.
    
    <li>The parakeet family, Psittaculidae, which is widespread in much of Africa, 
    Asia and Australia.</li>
    <li>The parrot family, Psittacidae, which mainly lives in tropical America and Africa.
    The cockatoo family, Cacatuidae, found in Australia, New Guinea and some islands 
    in Asia.</li>
    <li>The Kakapo family, Strigopidae, found only in New Zealand.</li>

    <h1>The parrot family</h1>
        The parrot family is a family of birds in the order parrot birds.
    
        They live mainly in tropical America and Africa. In English, the family is 
        therefore called New World and African Parrots, ie parrots from the New World 
        and Africa.
    
        The macaws from South America and the jacko from Africa are examples of members 
        of the parrot family.
        Not all birds called parrots belong to the parrot family. Also in the parakeet 
        family there are many species with a parrot in the name. In addition, parrots are used as a collective term for the parrot birds, which also includes the cockatoo family and the cockatoo family.
