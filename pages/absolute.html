    <h1>Stingrays</h1>
        <p>Stingrays are a group of sea rays, which are cartilaginous fish related to 
        sharks. They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order 
        Myliobatiformes and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill 
        stingray), Plesiobatidae (deepwater stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees),
        Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae
        (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (butterfly rays), and Myliobatidae (eagle rays).

        Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout 
        the world. Some species, such as Dasyatis thetidis, are found in warmer temperate 
        oceans, and others, such as Plesiobatis daviesi, are found in the deep ocean. The 
        river stingrays, and a number of whiptail stingrays (such as the Niger stingray), 
        are restricted to fresh water. Most myliobatoids are demersal (inhabiting the next-
        to-lowest zone in the water column), but some, such as the pelagic stingray and the 
        eagle rays, are pelagic.[3]
    
        There are about 220 known stingray species organized into ten families and 29 genera.
        Stingray species are progressively becoming threatened or vulnerable to extinction,
        particularly as the consequence of unregulated fishing.[4] As of 2013, 45 species 
        have been listed as vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN. The status of some other 
        species is poorly known, leading to their being listed as data deficient.

    <h1>Locomotion</h1>
    
        The stingray uses its paired pectoral fins for moving around. This is in contrast to
        sharks and most other fish, which get most of their swimming power from a single 
        caudal (tail) fin. Stingray pectoral fin locomotion can be divided into two 
        categories: undulatory and oscillatory. Stingrays who use undulatory locomotion
        have shorter thicker fins for slower motile movements in benthic areas. Longer 
        thinner pectoral fins make for faster speeds in oscillation mobility in pelagic zones
        . Visually distinguishable oscillation has less than one wave going, opposed to 
        undulation having more than one wave at all times.[26]

        The venom of the stingray has been relatively unstudied due to the mixture of 
        venomous tissue secretions cells and mucous membrane cell products that occurs
        upon secretion from the spinal blade. Stingrays can have anywhere between one 
        and three blades. The spine is covered with the epidermal skin layer. During 
        secretion, the venom penetrates the epidermis and mixes with the mucus to release 
        the venom on its victim. Typically, other venomous organisms create and store their 
        venom in a gland. The stingray is notable in that it stores its venom within tissue
        cells. The toxins that have been confirmed to be within the venom are cystatins, 
        peroxiredoxin, and galectin.[39] Galectin induces cell death in its victims and 
        cystatins inhibit defense enzymes. In humans, these toxins lead to increased blood 
        flow in the superficial capillaries and cell death.[40] Despite the number of cells
        and toxins that are within the stingray, there is little relative energy required 
        to produce and store the venom.</p>
